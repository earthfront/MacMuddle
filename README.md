Tired of free public WIFI access points limiting your download capacity? This is a common theme while traveling.

This is a script written in D which scrambles the primary wireless devices' MAC address, provided that the hardware supports this (tested only on my Ubuntu Sony Vaio VPC series laptop).

With a new MAC address, the WIFI access point won't recognize your device, and the download limits are set anew!
